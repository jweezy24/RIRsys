## Python Virtual Environment Setup

We recomend the use of a python virtual environment for ease of dependency management.
The process is outlined below:

1. `python -m venv RIRsys` This command creates a virtual environment within the current directory.
2. `source RIRsys/bin/activate` This command allows you to enter the environment. 
3. `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` Finally, this command will install the local dependencies.
